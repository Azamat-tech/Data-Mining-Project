# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Background

In this project, I analyzed life expectancy over the world based on various factors. Additionally, I analyzed the world's life expectancy with the specific country - Kyrgyzstan.

### Main Questions Directed

1. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans in developed and developing countries?

2. What is the impact of economical factor on life Expectancy?

3. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?

## Data

Inside the `'\data'` folder, you can find the following datasets:

1. data - dataset on life expectancy and various factors affecting it. It includes the data for 193 countries from year 2000-2015
2. continents - dataset of life expectancy that includes the continents of the countries

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Python, and the Jupyter Notebook was used as the primary development environment. I used various data mining and machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between life expectancy and various factors.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AzamatZarlykov/LifeExpectancyEDA.git
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

4. Navigate to the project folder and open the life-expectancy-analysis.ipynb file.

You should now be able to run the code and replicate the analysis.
